          <p className="py-2 text-gray-600">
            I specialize in building mobile responsive front-end UI applications. Iâ€™m
            passionate about learning new technologies and understand there is more than
            one way to accomplish a task. Though I am most proficient in building
            front-end applications using HTML, CSS, Javascript, and React, I am a quick
            learner and can pick up new tech stacks as needed. I believe that being a
            great developer is not using one specific language, but choosing the best tool
            for the job.
          </p>
          <p className="py-2 text-gray-600">
            I started web development in 2021 building multiple websites. I have
            experience working with a interdisciplinary team, delegating and mentoring
            less experienced devs and taking mock wireframes all the way to deployed
            applications.
